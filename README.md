# ReacTicTacToe

This React app was used to develop my knowledge of the frontend framework including Components, States, and Immutability. 


## Getting Started

This application was originally designed to be run on localhost using npm - it is possible to see the application in action by cloning the repository and running `npm start` then viewing the application on a browser at `http://localhost:3000`.  

```
npm start
```

### Prerequisites

Ideally the most recent npm and NodeJS versions, I used the following when building and testing the application.

```
Node v8.15.1  npm version 6.4.1
```

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Front End Framework 


## Acknowledgments
